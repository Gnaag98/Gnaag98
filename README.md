### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Master of Science in Engineering Physics at UmeÃ¥ University in Sweeden.
- ğŸŒ± I like to reinvent the wheel to learn how to program. Currently I'm sporadically writing a Smart Home Hub on a Raspberry Pi in C++ to interface with 433 Mhz devices, just so see if I can.
